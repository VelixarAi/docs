## How overages work

On paid plans, you're never hard-blocked. If you exceed your plan's monthly limits, overage charges apply automatically via Stripe metered billing.

## Overage rates

| Operation | Overage price |
|---|---|
| Memory stores | $2.00 per 1,000 over limit |
| Retrievals | $1.00 per 1,000 over limit |

## Example

On the **Pro** plan (50K memories, 250K retrievals):
- You store 55,000 memories → 5,000 over → **$10.00** overage
- You make 260,000 retrievals → 10,000 over → **$10.00** overage

Total bill: $30 (plan) + $20 (overage) = **$50**

## Monitoring

Track your usage in real-time from the [API Usage dashboard](https://velixarai.com/settings/api-usage) to avoid unexpected charges.

<Tip>
  If you're consistently hitting overages, upgrade to the next tier — it's almost always cheaper than paying overage rates.
