## Monthly limits

Each plan has monthly limits for **memory stores** and **retrievals**. Usage resets on the 1st of each month (UTC).

Check your current usage via the [dashboard](https://app.velixar.ai/settings/api-usage) or API:

```bash
curl https://api.velixar.ai/v1/usage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer vlx_your_key"
```

## Rate limiting

Rate limits are per-minute, per API key. When exceeded, the API returns `429`:

```json
{
  "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "retry_after": 42
}
```

Response headers on every request:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 300
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 287
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1708099260
```

## Free tier behavior

On the free tier, requests are **hard-blocked** when limits are reached. No overage is allowed.

## Paid tier behavior

On paid tiers, requests continue past the limit and overage charges apply. See [Overages](/billing/overages).
