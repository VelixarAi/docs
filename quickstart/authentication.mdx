## API Keys

All requests require a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer vlx_your_api_key_here
```

Get your key from the [Velixar Dashboard](https://velixarai.com/settings/api-keys).

## Scopes

API keys can be scoped to limit access:

| Scope | Description |
|---|---|
| `memory:read` | Search and retrieve memories |
| `memory:write` | Store new memories |
| `memory:delete` | Delete memories |
| `admin` | Full access to all operations |

By default, new keys are created with `memory:read` + `memory:write`.

## Rate limits

Rate limits are applied per API key based on your plan:

| Plan | Requests/min |
|---|---|
| Free | 30 |
| Pro | 300 |
| Power | 1,000 |
| Teams | 2,000 |
| Max | 5,000 |

When rate limited, the API returns `429` with headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 30
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1708099260
```

## Error responses

```json
{
  "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Retry after 2026-02-16T10:31:00Z",
  "retry_after": 42
}
```

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `401` | Missing or invalid API key |
| `403` | Key lacks required scope |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded |
