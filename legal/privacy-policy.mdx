# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: February 28, 2026**

Velixar AI ("we", "us", "our") operates the Velixar platform, APIs, and related services. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## 1. Information We Collect

**Account Information:** Email address, name, and payment details when you sign up for a paid plan.

**Usage Data:** API request logs (timestamps, endpoints, response codes, latency), rate limit counters, and error logs. We do not log request or response bodies.

**Memory Data:** Content you store through the API ("Your Data"). This is stored encrypted at rest and is only accessible to you (or your organization members, if using Team Workspaces).

**Cookies:** We use essential cookies for authentication. No third-party tracking cookies.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

- To provide and maintain the Service
- To process billing and payments

- To monitor and improve Service performance and reliability
- To enforce our Terms of Service

We do **not** use Your Data to train AI models. We do **not** sell your information to third parties.

## 3. Data Storage & Security

- All data is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- Memory data is stored in AWS infrastructure (us-east-1)
- API keys are hashed; we cannot retrieve your key after creation
- We use Supabase with Row Level Security for data isolation between users and organizations

## 4. Data Retention

- **Your Data:** Retained as long as your account is active. Deleted within 30 days of account deletion.
- **Usage Logs:** Retained for 90 days for debugging and abuse prevention.
- **Billing Records:** Retained as required by law (typically 7 years).
