# What is Velixar?

Velixar is a **memory layer for AI**. It gives your LLM-powered applications persistent, semantic memory — so they remember users, learn preferences, and retrieve relevant context automatically.

## Why Velixar?

LLMs are stateless. Every conversation starts from zero. Velixar fixes that.

| Without Velixar | With Velixar |
|---|---|
| User repeats preferences every session | Preferences recalled automatically |
| No context between conversations | Full conversation history available |
| Generic responses for every user | Personalized responses from memory |
| Manual RAG pipeline management | Semantic search built in |

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Store">
    Send memories to the API — facts, preferences, context, decisions. Each memory is embedded and indexed for semantic search.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Recall">
    Query with natural language. Velixar returns the most relevant memories ranked by semantic similarity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto-extract">
    Enable auto-extraction and Velixar pulls key facts from conversations automatically — no manual tagging needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key features

- **Semantic search** — Find memories by meaning, not just keywords
- **Tiered storage** — Pin critical facts (tier 0), session context (tier 1), semantic (tier 2), org-wide (tier 3)
- **Auto-extraction** — Automatically extract memories from conversations with deduplication
- **Conflict resolution** — New information supersedes old, stale memories are cleaned up
- **Multi-tenant** — Isolate memories per user, per workspace, or share across an org
- **SDKs** — Python and JavaScript clients, plus LangChain integration
