A **memory** is a unit of knowledge stored in Velixar. It can be a fact, a preference, a decision, a conversation summary — anything your AI should remember.

## Memory structure

```json
{
  "id": "mem_abc123",
  "content": "User prefers dark mode and metric units",
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "tier": 0,
  "type": "preference",
  "tags": ["settings", "ui"],
  "metadata": {},
  "score": 0.92,
  "created_at": "2026-02-16T10:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-02-16T10:30:00Z"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique memory ID (UUID) |
| `content` | string | The memory text — this is what gets embedded and searched |
| `user_id` | string | Owner of this memory, for multi-user isolation |
| `tier` | integer | Storage tier (0–3), controls priority and retention |
| `type` | string | `fact`, `preference`, `context`, or custom |
| `tags` | array | Filterable labels |
| `metadata` | object | Arbitrary key-value data |
| `score` | float | Relevance score (only in search results) |

## Memory types

- **fact** — Objective information: "User's company is Acme Corp"
- **preference** — User choices: "Prefers concise responses"
- **context** — Situational: "Currently working on Q1 budget"
- **custom** — Any string you define

## Embedding & search

When you store a memory, Velixar generates a vector embedding of the `content` field. Search queries are also embedded, and results are ranked by cosine similarity.

This means you search by **meaning**, not keywords:
- Query: "what color does the user like?" → matches "User's favorite color is blue"
- Query: "display settings" → matches "User prefers dark mode"
