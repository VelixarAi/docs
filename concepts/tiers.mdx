Velixar uses a 4-tier system to prioritize memories during recall. Higher-priority tiers are always returned first.

## Tier overview

| Tier | Name | Purpose | Retention |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | Pinned | Critical facts & preferences | Permanent until deleted |
| **1** | Session | Current session context | Expires with session |
| **2** | Semantic | General knowledge (default) | Managed by relevance decay |
| **3** | Organization | Shared across all users in a workspace | Permanent |

## How tiers affect search

When you search memories, results from lower-numbered tiers are boosted:

```
Final score = similarity_score × tier_boost
```

| Tier | Boost |
|---|---|
| 0 | 1.5× |
| 1 | 1.2× |
| 2 | 1.0× |
| 3 | 1.1× |

This means a tier-0 memory with 0.7 similarity outranks a tier-2 memory with 0.9 similarity.

## Auto-tier routing

When using [auto-extraction](/concepts/extraction), Velixar automatically assigns tiers based on salience:

- **Salience ≥ 0.8** → Tier 0 (pinned) — high-confidence facts and preferences
- **Salience < 0.8** → Tier 2 (semantic) — general context

You can always override the tier manually via the API.

## Examples

```bash
# Pin a critical preference (tier 0)
curl -X POST https://api.velixarai.com/v1/memory \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer vlx_your_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "User is allergic to peanuts", "tier": 0, "type": "fact"}'

# Store session context (tier 1)
curl -X POST https://api.velixarai.com/v1/memory \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer vlx_your_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Currently debugging auth flow", "tier": 1, "type": "context"}'

# Org-wide knowledge (tier 3)
curl -X POST https://api.velixarai.com/v1/memory \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer vlx_your_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Company uses PostgreSQL for all services", "tier": 3, "type": "fact"}'
```
