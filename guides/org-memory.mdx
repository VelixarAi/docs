# Organization Memory

Organization Memory lets teams share knowledge across members. Memories flow from individual → team → organization scope through a promotion workflow.

## How It Works

1. A team member **commits** a memory to their team workspace
2. Managers can **promote** team memories to organization-wide scope
3. All members can **retrieve** memories from their team and org scopes
4. Semantic search works across all scopes you have access to

## Scopes

| Scope | Visibility | Who Can Write |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Team | Team members only | Any team member |
| Organization | All org members | Managers (via promotion) |

## Tiers

Organization Memory requires a **Team plan** ($20/seat/month, 5-seat minimum). Each seat includes 5,000 org memories. Orgs are auto-provisioned on Team plan checkout.

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are at `https://api.velixarai.com/v1/org/memory/{action}` and require a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header.

### Commit

Store a memory in your team workspace.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.velixarai.com/v1/org/memory/commit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Our API rate limit is 1000 req/min for enterprise clients",
    "tags": ["api", "rate-limits"],
    "type": "team"
  }'
```

Committed memories are automatically embedded for semantic search.

### Retrieve

Search memories across your team and organization scopes.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.velixarai.com/v1/org/memory/retrieve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "rate limits",
    "scope": "all"
  }'
```

The `scope` parameter accepts `team`, `org`, or `all` (default).

### Submit

Submit a team memory for promotion to organization scope.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.velixarai.com/v1/org/memory/submit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "memory_id": "uuid-of-team-memory"
  }'
```

### Queue

List pending promotion requests (managers and admins only).

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.velixarai.com/v1/org/memory/queue \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT"
```

### Promote

Approve or reject a promotion request (managers and admins only).

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.velixarai.com/v1/org/memory/promote \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "memory_id": "uuid-from-queue",
    "action": "approve"
  }'
```

Use `"action": "reject"` to decline.

## Dashboard

The Organization dashboard at [velixarai.com/org](https://velixarai.com/org) provides:

- **Overview** — member count, memory stats, activity feed, contributions chart
- **Team Memories** — commit, search, filter by scope, promote
- **Promotion Queue** — approve/reject pending promotions (managers only)
- **Audit Log** — full history of commits, promotions, and member changes (managers only)
- **Settings** — manage teams, members, roles, and invitations (admins only)

## Roles

| Role | Commit | Retrieve | Promote | Manage Members |
|------|--------|----------|---------|----------------|
| Member | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manager | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Admin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Notifications

Managers receive real-time notifications when team members submit memories for promotion. Notifications appear in the bell icon in the navbar.
