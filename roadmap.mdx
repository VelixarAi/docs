## Coming Soon

Features actively in development.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Team Workspaces" icon="users">
    Shared memory namespaces for teams. Invite members, manage permissions with RBAC, and share org-wide knowledge across your team's AI applications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Webhooks & Events" icon="bell">
    Subscribe to memory lifecycle events — new memory stored, conflict resolved, memory deleted. Push notifications to your app in real-time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memory Analytics" icon="chart-line">
    Insights into how your memories are being used — most recalled, least accessed, storage trends, and search patterns.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Batch Operations" icon="layer-group">
    Store, update, or delete memories in bulk with a single API call. Import existing knowledge bases efficiently.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Planned

On the roadmap, not yet in development.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Memory Expiration" icon="clock">
    Set TTLs on memories. Session context auto-expires, while pinned facts persist forever. Fine-grained retention policies per tier.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-modal Memories" icon="image">
    Store and recall images, audio transcripts, and structured data alongside text memories.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memory Graph" icon="diagram-project">
    Relationship-aware memory. Link memories together — "User works at Acme" connects to "Acme uses PostgreSQL" for deeper context retrieval.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-hosted Option" icon="server">
    Deploy Velixar in your own AWS account. Full data sovereignty with the same API and SDKs.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
